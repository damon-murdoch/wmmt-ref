### Introduction
Hello! I'm Damon, also known as Scrubbs and last year
I started playing Maximum Tune 6. I had no idea where 
to find resources when I started playing, and as I've 
started to take it more seriously I've been searching
for tools and guides on how to race competitively.

I've created this document for myself, as a way to 
look up information quickly as I need it when playing
and practising as well as recording useful information
I find which may benefit newer players and my friends.

### Frequently Asked Questions
#### How do I increase my car's level? 
There are a number of ways to increase your car's level. 
These include Milestones such as first 100 online trophies
or VS battle stars, then 200, 500 and so on. 

Another way to progress is through the ghost battle mode, 
specifically Japan Challenge. Japan Challenge grants you
a rank up every 25 races for the first 200 races, but then
gets progressively slower as it goes on. 

For a full breakdown of the progression, please look at 
the table [here](#japan-challenge-rank-up-guide).
