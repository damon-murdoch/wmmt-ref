### Introduction
Hello! I'm Damon, also known as Scrubbs and last year
I started playing Maximum Tune 6. I had no idea where 
to find resources when I started playing, and as I've 
started to take it more seriously I've been searching
for tools and guides on how to race competitively.

I've created this document for myself, as a way to 
look up information quickly as I need it when playing
and practising as well as recording useful information
I find which may benefit newer players and my friends.
